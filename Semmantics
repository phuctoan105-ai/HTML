                <h2> Hamburgers </h2>
                <p>A hamburger, or burger, is a popular sandwich featuring a cooked patty (usually ground beef) served in a sliced bun, often with toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, and condiments like ketchup or mustard, originating from German/American food traditions and evolving into a global fast-food staple. It's a versatile meal, from quick fast-food to gourmet versions with diverse patties (turkey, chicken, veggie) and creative toppings, but the classic remains a grilled or fried beef patty in a soft bun. </p>

                <h2>Ice cream</h2>
                <p>Ice cream is a sweet, frozen dessert made from a base of milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings, churned while freezing to incorporate air and create a smooth, semi-solid foam with tiny ice crystals. To be legally called ice cream in the U.S., it must contain at least 10% milkfat, contributing to its rich texture, with common additions like fruits, nuts, or chocolate for variety. </p>
