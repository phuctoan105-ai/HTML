        <p>Tennis is a popular racket sport played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players (doubles). Using stringed rackets, players hit a felt-covered hollow ball over a net, aiming to land it within the court boundaries in a way that prevents the opponent from returning it. It is a competitive, strategic sport played on various surfaces, including grass, clay, and hardcourts. </p>

        <p>Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport played indoors on a court divided by a net, either in singles (1v1) or doubles (2v2). Players use lightweight rackets to hit a shuttlecock—a feathered or synthetic projectile—over the net, aiming to land it in the opponent's court. It requires high agility, speed, and reflexes, with matches played to 21 points in a best-of-three format. </p>
